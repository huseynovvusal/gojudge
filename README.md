# GoJudge üöÄ

Blazingly Fast & Secure Code Execution Platform Powered by nsjail üî•üõ°Ô∏è

---

## Overview

GoJudge is a high-performance, secure, and extensible code execution engine designed for online judges, code runners, and educational platforms. It leverages [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail) for robust sandboxing, ensuring every code execution is isolated, safe, and resource-limited.

- **Languages Supported:** Python, C, C++, Go
- **API:** gRPC-based for lightning-fast communication
- **Security:** Each submission runs in a hardened nsjail sandbox
- **Performance:** Optimized for minimal overhead and rapid execution
- **Containerized:** Easy deployment with Docker

---

## Features ‚ú®

- **gRPC API:** Modern, efficient, and scalable interface for code execution
- **Multi-language Support:** Python, C, C++, Go (easily extendable)
- **Resource Limits:** Time, memory, and CPU restrictions per execution
- **Postman Collection:** Ready-to-use API samples ([see below](#api-sample))
- **Dockerized:** One-command setup for local or cloud environments
- **Makefile:** Simple build, run, and clean commands

---

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

- **`cmd/server/main.go`:** gRPC server entrypoint
- **`internal/executor/`:** Language-specific execution logic, all sandboxed with nsjail
- **`proto/`:** Protocol Buffers definitions for the gRPC API
- **`Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml`:** Containerization and orchestration
- **`Makefile`:** Build and automation scripts

## Quick Start üö¶

### 1. Build & Run with Docker

```sh
docker build -t gojudge .
docker run -p 50051:50051 gojudge
```

### 2. Local Development

```sh
make build
make run
```

### 3. Generate gRPC Code

```sh
make proto
```

## gRPC Request Examples üõ∞Ô∏è

### 1. Using Go Client

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	pb "huseynovvusal/gojudge/internal/proto"
)

func main() {
	conn, err := grpc.Dial("localhost:50051", grpc.WithInsecure())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("did not connect: %v", err)
	}
	defer conn.Close()
	client := pb.NewExecutorServiceClient(conn)

	req := &pb.ExecutorRequest{
		Code:      "print('Hello, World!')",
		Input:     "",
		Language:  "python",
		TimeLimit: 2,
		MemoryLimit: 256,
		CpuLimit: 1,
	}
	resp, err := client.Execute(context.Background(), req)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Execution error: %v", err)
	}
	log.Printf("Output: %s", resp.Output)
	log.Printf("Execution Time: %d ms", resp.ExecutionTime)
}
```

### 2. Using grpcurl

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"code":"print(\"Hello, World!\")","input":"","language":"python","time_limit":2,"memory_limit":256,"cpu_limit":1}' \
  localhost:50051 executor.ExecutorService/Execute
```
